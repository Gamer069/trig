# Trig

## Building the project

To build this project, just do
```
cmake .
```
.
I recommend using the unix makefile generator for it. 
And then, just 
```
make
```
It will generate a "Trig" binary and from there you can run it.

## PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CLONED IT CORRECTLY
use --recursive when cloning because this repo has submodules (well duh bc C++ library management is impossible)
